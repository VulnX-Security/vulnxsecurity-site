excerpt: "A practical roadmap to reduce risk fast — policy gaps, identity weaknesses, and quick wins that matter."

When attackers look at your environment, they don't see policies — they see *paths*.

A Security Program Assessment maps your current controls against frameworks like **NIST** and **CIS**, then prioritizes **quick wins** that reduce real-world risk: identity hardening, patch cadence, privileged access, and email defense.

**What you get:**
- A prioritized roadmap aligned to business impact
- Clear owners and timelines
- Metrics that demonstrate improvement quarter over quarter

If you want an external view of where to focus, start here — then test it with a **targeted red-team exercise** to measure effectiveness.
